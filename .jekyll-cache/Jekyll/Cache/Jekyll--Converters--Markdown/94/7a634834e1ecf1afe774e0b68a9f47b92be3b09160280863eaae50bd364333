I"ù<p>Last year, we did a recap with what we thought were the <a href="https://tryolabs.com/blog/2015/12/15/top-10-python-libraries-of-2015/">best Python libraries of 2015</a>, which was widely shared within the Python community (see post in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3wyiuv/top_10_python_libraries_of_2015/">r/Python</a>). A year has gone by, and again it is time to give due credit for the awesome work that has been done by the <strong>open source community</strong> this year.</p>
